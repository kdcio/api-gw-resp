# Changesets

API Gateway Response Builder uses [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to do versioning. What that means for contributors is that you need to add a changeset by running `npm run changeset` which contains what packages should be bumped, their associated semver bump types and some markdown which will be inserted into changelogs.
